In our project we made a game where there is one player in a empty map with a end green finish The goal of the game is to get the player to navigate around the map until you reach the end point, once you reach the end point you win the game.

<p>During this lab I learned how to program better. The best and most useful thing is the copy and paste feature to be honest there was a lot of tedious repeating of code and sometimes when needed i could go back to other labs see the code and use it again but a more modified version. </p>
<h1> WAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH OMG NO WAY </h1>

<p> this code here was used to make the dream of returning the player back to the original spawn point extremely difficult and complicated but possible so yay </p>
